Hello, this is my portfolio.

Here you can check some of my work, from the beginning of my learning path, until now. I'm still acquiring new knowledge, and hope you can notice the great chances into this 
great journey with me.

I'm more than open to recieving suggestions for this -or any- of my repositories. Your comments might help me become a better professional! :)
