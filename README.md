Hello, this is my portfolio.

Here you can check some of my work, from the beginning of my learning path, until now. I'm still acquiring new knowledge, and I hope you can notice the great changes and new skills into this great journey with me.

I'm more than open to recieving suggestions for this -or any- of my repositories. Your comments might help me become a better professional! :)
